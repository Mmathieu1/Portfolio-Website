                                    Currently in it's concept phase, Pawsitive Match Maker will be used to create
                                    wonderful profiles for available pets at the shelter a user is visiting. I have
                                    volunteered and even worked at my local County Animal Shelter. While I enjoyed
                                    finding homes for animals in need, the orginization and paperwork would get
                                    overwhelming and confusing to say the least.-And I worked there, it was even more
                                    confusing for adopters.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On each kennel there would be a plastic
                                    paper protector ziptied with a printed copy of the pet's profile from their shelter
                                    program. A wide range of pets took more than one page of paper, which ment a
                                    potential adopter would have to take the paper out read it and put it back
                                    (hopefully).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are alot of dissadvantages with this method:
                                    <p>1) The font is extreamly small,
                                        making it hard to find the desired info on the profile.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>2) Printer out of ink? The
                                        quality of the print out would suffer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>3) Many pet's have urgent and important info
                                        that needs to stand out before anything else (such as Medical needs or behaviorl
                                        requirments). And with this paper method these needs just aren't eye catching
                                        enough.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>4) Shelter employees and adopters alike have difficulty keeping track of the
                                        current location of pets if they are not currently in the kennels.
                                    </p>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is where Pawsitive Match Maker will step in and make the adoption process
                                    smoother for both employees and potential adopters. Pawsitive Match Maker will
                                    create colorful and easy to read profiles for the animals currently in the shelter's
                                    care. Potential adopters will be able to download and use this app while they look
                                    around at the ones available. the profiles will contain all urgent information as
                                    well as a customizable profile sumamry and photo. The app will also keep track of
                                    where that pet is currently located, whether it is in the play yard, foster care or
                                    in an adoption interview.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Adopting a pet into a family is fun, rewarding and should be a positive expirience.
                                    Pawsitive Match Maker will strive to be that expirience and so much more.
